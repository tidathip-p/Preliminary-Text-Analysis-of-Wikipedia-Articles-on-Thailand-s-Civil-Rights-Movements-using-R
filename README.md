# 📘 Preliminary Text Analysis of Wikipedia Articles on Thailand's Civil Rights Movements using R

## 🧠 Overview
This project conducts an exploratory text analysis of Wikipedia articles related to Thailand’s civil rights movements. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including word cloud visualization and sentiment analysis, the study aims to uncover significant shifts in how these historical events are portrayed and perceived over time.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze Wikipedia articles tied to major civil rights events in Thailand.
- Identify common terms, bigrams, and sentiments across documents.
- Visualize key linguistic trends and co-occurring terms to better understand thematic consistencies.
- Reflect on the reliability and framing of public knowledge through Wikipedia content.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- High-frequency terms across articles include *protest*, *government*, *students*, and *military*, highlighting the recurring role of student movements and state responses.
- Sentiment analysis suggests a prevalence of negative sentiment around government responses and violence, especially in the 1976 and 2020–21 articles.
- Bigrams like *student movement*, *military coup*, and *police forces* reflect key structural themes in Thailand’s civil resistance history.
- Wikipedia serves as a semi-structured public record, but the linguistic framing suggests varying levels of neutrality and potential gaps in narrative representation.
